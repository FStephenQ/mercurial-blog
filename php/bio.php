		<p><h3>I am currently an undergraduate, majoring in Computer Science, 
			at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</p></h3>

		<p>I have spent several years independently studying client-side application development, mainly focusing on C, Java, and Python for the GNU/Linux ecosystem. Recently, I have begun to focus on web development, learning PHP, Javascript, and HTML5/CSS. This website is the product of that focus, and will hopefully develop along with my knowlege. </p>
		<p>Academically, I have taken courses focusing on large-project collaboration, operating system development, and pattern-based design, along with standard courses on data structures, algorythims, and programming methodology.
		I am passably fluent in the following languages for most tasks: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>C</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Common Lisp</li>
		</ul>
	<p> I am also proficient in the use of Bash scripting, Perl, Awk, and ASM.
	I am an experienced Linux sysadmin, an amature locksmith, and a passable writter.</br>
		Feel free to contact me at any time.</p>
