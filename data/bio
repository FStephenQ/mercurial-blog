		<p><h3>I am currently an undergraduate, majoring in Computer Science, </br>
			at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</p></h3>

		<p>As you may notice, I have very little experience with web languages.</br>
		Hopefully this will be rectified shortly, and this page will become signifigantly less ugly</p>
		<p>The main thrust of my education so far has instead been focused in systems and applications programming.</br>
		I am passably fluent in the following languages for most such tasks: </br></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>C</li>
			<li>x86 Assembler (asm)</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Perl</li>
		</ul>
	<p>	Besides this, I am a very capable Linux sysadmin, an amature locksmith, and a fairly bad writter.</br>
		Feel free to contact me at any time.</p>
